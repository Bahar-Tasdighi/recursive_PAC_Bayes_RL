## Overview

This repository contains code accompanying the paper  
**_Deep Actor-Critics with Tight Risk Certificates_**.

The paper introduces a deep actor–critic framework for risk-constrained reinforcement learning, providing *tight, state-dependent risk certificates* that quantify safety and constraint satisfaction during learning and deployment for Actor critic reinforcement learning agents.
